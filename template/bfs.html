  <p style ="font-size:20px;">Breadth-First Search in the context of a maze involves systematically exploring the maze's cells in a level-by-level manner, starting from the entrance. It begins by marking the entrance as visited and enqueuing it. The algorithm then dequeues cells, explores unvisited neighbors, marks them as visited, and enqueues them. This process continues until the destination is reached or all accessible cells are visited. BFS ensures the shortest path is found because it explores all cells at the same distance from the start before moving to farther cells. Once the destination is reached, the shortest path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the destination to the entrance based on recorded information during traversal.‚Äù
